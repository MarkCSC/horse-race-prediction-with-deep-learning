# Comparison of Different Methods for Horse Racing Prediction

Welcome to the repository for the project. This project focuses on comparing different machine learning models to predict the finishing times of horses in races, using data from Hong Kong's prestigious horse racing events.

## Project Overview

Horse racing, a sport rich in history and tradition, is not only a test of athleticism and speed but also a significant field of study in predictive analytics. This project leverages various statistical and machine learning methods to predict outcomes in horse races, specifically focusing on the accuracy of predicting finishing times based on historical data.

### Objectives

- To evaluate and compare the performance of different predictive models like Fully-Connected Networks, LSTM Networks, and XGBoost.
- To understand the impact of feature selection and preprocessing on the model's performance.
- To provide insights that could potentially help in betting strategies and race analysis.

### Data Source

The data used in this project was scraped from the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) website. It includes comprehensive details about each race and horse, providing a robust dataset for analysis.

### Models Explored

- **Fully-Connected Neural Network**: A basic ANN model used for regression of finishing times.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of RNN suitable for sequences such as the series of races a horse has participated in.
- **XGBoost**: An implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance.
